                        <p class="testimonial-quote">I've always been the kind of person who runs away from anything related to fitness or exercise. But pregnancy changed that for me. For my health and my baby's, my doctor strongly recommended incorporating yoga and strength training into my routine. Luckily, I got in touch with Dr. Rasheeda, and that made all the difference. One of her greatest strengths is that, being a doctor herself, she has a deep understanding of the body and its anatomy. But what truly sets her apart is her unmatched attention to detail. With hawk-like focus, she watches every movement — if your posture isn't right, she immediately and patiently corrects you until you get it right. She creates such a positive, motivating environment that, thanks to her, I now genuinely look forward to my sessions.</p>

Her expertise in strength training and nutrition helped me shed 5kgs in just 6 weeks, while also increasing my energy levels and enthusiasm throughout the day. I learned the importance of healthy eating habits and proper portion control and was able to overcome obstacles to sustain my goals. Rasheeda truly cares about her client's success and is an excellent coach - I highly recommend her to anyone looking to make positive changes in their lifestyle!</p>

My biggest challenges were staying accountable and avoiding boredom in my workouts — but she completely changed that for me. She ensures I stay consistent and takes the time to explain every aspect of each exercise, including which muscles are being worked.</p>

Her warm-ups included nerve stretches & the actual workout included 2 combines movements which is not the case in my other sessions. She was super Vigilant the entire time about my posture. Just in one session, Rasheeda was able to tell me what exactly I need to work on & what are the weak areas of my body and introduced a concept of unilateral strengthening.</p>

She has been incredibly patient, kind, and attentive throughout our training sessions, ensuring that I never felt any discomfort or pain. Rashida has been instrumental in my progress, and I can now stand for extended periods without any pain, making it easier for me to pray namaaz. Her guidance during exercise has been exceptional, always checking on my well-being and ensuring that I perform the exercises correctly without putting pressure on my knees.</p>

When I first started over a year ago, my severe knee pain made even basic movements challenging. I had to rely on modified exercises just to keep going. But with patience, consistency, and Dr. Rasheeda's guidance, things started to change. Slowly but surely, I began to feel stronger. The modifications became fewer, my knee pain eased, and I found myself doing exercises I never thought possible. More than just physical strength, this journey has given me renewed energy and confidence.</p>
